# MiniMax-TicTacToe
TicTacToe game implementation using Go. This project was developed as a final project for the Optmization II class. The end goal was to create the perfect adversary using the MiniMax Theorem.

## MiniMax Theorem
In Game Theory, the minimax theorem defines that in every Sum-Zero game with two players, assuming both players play their optimal choices every turn, the best strategy for each is to find a move that maximizes their own "minimum gain"(Max Min). Basically, a decision rule that minimizes the worst case scenario for the given player. The player has to consider all of the best opponent responses for each of his potential choices.
